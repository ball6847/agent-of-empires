//! The CityHall config bundle: one document describing how a CityHall-hosted
//! aoe workspace should be set up (#8).
//!
//! CityHall runs one locked-down `aoe serve --cityhall` per user, and in that
//! mode the routes that would configure it are closed: `PATCH /api/settings`,
//! `POST /api/projects` and `POST /api/git/clone` all sit in
//! `CITYHALL_MUTATION_DENY`. So configuration cannot arrive over the workspace's
//! own API; it arrives as this document, applied at boot below the HTTP layer.
//!
//! The round trip is:
//!
//! 1. An admin configures a normal aoe install, then [`export`]s a bundle
//!    (`aoe cityhall export`, or the Settings page's CityHall tab).
//! 2. CityHall stores that file and serves it, per user, to each workspace it
//!    spawns, splicing in the `[git]` section (see below).
//! 3. The workspace fetches it at boot and [`apply`]s it.
//!
//! Two deliberate shapes:
//!
//! - `settings` is a **sparse** patch keyed by section then field, the same
//!   shape a `PATCH /api/settings` body has, so it validates through
//!   [`validate_patch`] and merges through [`merge_json`] with no second code
//!   path. Only leaves that differ from [`Config::default`] are exported.
//! - `projects` carries **remotes, not paths**. A [`Project`] is a path to an
//!   already-cloned repo, and the admin's `/Users/me/src/foo` means nothing
//!   inside a container, so [`apply`] clones each remote into the workspace and
//!   registers the resulting path.
//!
//! `[git]` is never exported and never stored by CityHall: it holds a
//! credential, and CityHall composes it per user when it serves the document.
//!
//! Known limit: a bundle sets values, it cannot unset them. A field whose value
//! is `null` (a cleared `Option`) is dropped on export, because TOML has no way
//! to spell it. Setting a field to some other value works normally.
