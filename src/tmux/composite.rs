//! Splice a tmux window's panes into one screen-shaped snapshot.
//!
//! `capture-pane` is per-pane and tmux has no command that returns a window
//! with its panes composited, so the preview historically showed only the
//! pinned `^.0` pane and a user's split was invisible (see
//! [`crate::tmux::Session::capture_window_composited`] for the capture side).
//! This module is the pure half: given each pane's geometry and its captured
//! rows, lay them back out on the window grid and draw tmux-style borders in
//! the gaps between them.
//!
//! Compositing is read-only and changes nothing about input routing, which
//! stays pinned to `^.0` (#435, #488).
