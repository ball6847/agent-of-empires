//! Post-create editing of a managed worktree session's workdir name.
//!
//! A session created in worktree mode bakes its directory name (and,
//! optionally, its branch) at creation time. This module performs the
//! in-place edit the user asks for later: move the worktree directory to a
//! new leaf name and, when opted in, rename the underlying git branch.
//!
//! Design notes (see #1723):
//!   - The new directory is a *sibling-leaf* rename: we keep the existing
//!     parent directory and only swap the final path component. We do NOT
//!     recompute the path from the current config template, because the
//!     random session-id seed used at creation is unrecoverable and the
//!     template may have drifted since, either of which would silently
//!     relocate the session somewhere unexpected.
//!   - Branch rename is opt-in. A session may have already done meaningful
//!     work on its branch (commits, an upstream), so renaming the branch is
//!     a separate, explicit choice from renaming the workdir directory.
//!   - Ordering is branch-rename first, then `git worktree move`. The
//!     filesystem move is the more failure-prone step (open handles, locks),
//!     so it goes last where a best-effort rollback of the branch rename is
//!     a cheap ref operation.
